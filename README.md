# Project

## Problem Description

Startups often face high uncertainty, and understanding the factors that lead to success or failure can be invaluable for entrepreneurs and investors. By analyzing the dataset from Crunchbase, we can identify key characteristics such as funding amounts, industry sectors, and geographical locations that distinguish successful startups from those that fail.

A machine learning model can be trained on this historical startup dataset to predict the likely outcome of a startup. The predictions can potentially help venture capitals and angel investors in making investment decisions.
